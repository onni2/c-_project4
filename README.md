   - This will generate two executables: `launcher.exe` and `game.exe`.

2. **Launch the Game:**
   - Run the `launcher.exe` to start the game.
   - Follow the prompts to create a character, select a weapon, and battle mobs.

## Files:
- **`launcher.exe`**: The main executable for starting the game.

- **`includes.h`**: This file contains the necessary headers for the project. i did this before todays lecture (14.3.25).

## Notes:
- The project was developed in C++.
- The includes were structured as per best practices after initial guidance.
